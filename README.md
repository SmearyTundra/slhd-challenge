<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We present the development of a classification system able to distinguish several distinct activities of daily living based on accelerometer measurements. The dataset comprises 468 events, each representing an activity performed by a single participant. Each event includes the activity label and three time series measurements corresponding to the accelerometer readings on the X, Y, and Z axis.
